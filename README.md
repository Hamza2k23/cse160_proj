# GPA vs. Background Project Description
**Group 6: Alex D'Alessandro, Max Jikharev, Hamza Shueib, Abby Vogel and Vic Collum**

At a high level our group is looking to determine the correlation between a student’s personal background and their middle/high school GPA. We believe that educational institutions across the country stand to gain from this research, and they would be our target audience. We hope that with our models they can determine better strategies to serve their respective community. 


We will be using data from https://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/, which provides data about a student’s GPA, as well as other features such as race and parent’s education. There are about 4,200 columns in total that we as a team will sift through in order to see which factors have the greatest influence on the student’s GPA.


We will test several models that will predict GPA based on the features in the columns, and we will also compare which set of columns create the most accurate model. Some of these models include linear regression and k-nearest neighbors, and we will evaluate the performance of our model based on its accuracy to predict GPA.

# Git refresh (important terminal commands to know)
- **git clone [repo url]** - clones remote repository to your computer (creates local repo)
- **git add .** - to stage all changes for commit (that period is intentional)
- **git status** - tells you which files are in staging area (i.e., added) 
- **git commit -m [commit message]** - to commit (save) changes, (try adding descripting messages that explain what you changed/added)
- **git log** - a log of all your commits. Each commit has a commit id that you can use to revert back to them. 
- **git push** - push changes to remote repository 
- **git pull** - pulls remote repository changes to local repo 
- **git revert [commit id]** - Swamped with merge conflicts, unfixable errors? git revert has your back. Used to revert back to old commits. 

# Git tips:
- Frequently make commits when you progress 
- Unless you know how to resolve merge conflicts, be cautious when git pulling. To be safe, only git pull during in-person meetings so you have others to help if conflicts arise.
- You have to git add before you git commit
