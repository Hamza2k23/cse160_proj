# GPA vs. Background Project Description
**Group 6: Alex D'Alessandro, Max Jikharev, Hamza Shueib, Abby Vogel and Vic Collum**

Your first project deliverable is a project description (as described on CourseSite) that one of you will need to post as a response to the obvious place in Piazza.  You'll need to think carefully about the realistic task and imagine a customer who would value the results of your task.  You'll need to understand the data you have selected (and produce a short data biography to demonstrate it).  Imagine exactly how you will model it (e.g., the "formula" that you would use in a model) so that you are clear about what you are predicting.  How will you evaluate the performance of your model?


At a high level our group is looking to determine the correlation between a student’s personal background and their middle/high school GPA. We believe that educational institutions across the country stand to gain from this research, and they would be our target audience. We hope that with our models they can determine better strategies to serve their respective community. 


We will be using data from https://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/, which provides data about a student’s GPA, as well as other features such as race and parent’s education. There are about 4,200 columns in total that we as a team will sift through in order to see which factors have the greatest influence on the student’s GPA.


We will test several models that will predict GPA based on the features in the columns, and we will also compare which set of columns create the most accurate model. Some of these models include linear regression and k-nearest neighbors, and we will evaluate the performance of our model based on its accuracy to predict GPA.
