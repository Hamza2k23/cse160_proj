Data retrieval and cleansing

```{r cars}
source("data.R")
#df <- get_data()
#write.csv(df, "cleaned.csv", row.names=T)

df2 <- read.csv("cleaned.csv", row.names=1, header=T)
df2
```

split data into training and test data, create k-folds
```{r}

```

split data
```{r}
list[test, train] <- get_split_data(df)
```

build model
```{r}
model <- build_model(train)
predictions <- build_predictions(model, test)
```

Plot model performance
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
